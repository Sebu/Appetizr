Indigo - rapid prototyping application framework inspired by RoR and Shoes

How it should work(but does not right now ):
  indigo my_app
  cd my_app
  .. create models and views
  ./start
  
Indigo uses ...
  ... a DSL to create/format view similar to the DSL of shoes ( http://github.com/why/shoes/tree/master ).
  ... rubigen to create app templaes
  ... active_record/resource for db and webservice access
  ... active_support for nice ruby extensions and I18n
  ... qtruby for the underlying widget rendering (can change in the future)
  ... some other extensions and ideas from RoR
  ... ruby-opengl for opengl support ;) (more on the why later)
