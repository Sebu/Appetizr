Indigo - rapid prototyping application framework inspired by RoR and Shoes

USAGE OF DEMO APP/FRAMEWORK
* 'rake db:migrate'
* 'script/start'

Differences to Rails
1. indigo is not RAILS
2. indigo uses multiple databases by default so
    schema.rb is db/schemas/db_name.rb
    migrations is db/migration/db_name/[0-9]*_*.rb
3. more 

TODO before first usefull release
* create a real initializer (with better internel config support for framework and app)
* improve ...
   ... Signaling (maybe use GObject?)
   ... the Rakefile
   ... migration support (get it to work correctly)
   ... the widgetery


Indigo uses ...
  ... a DSL to create/format view similar to the DSL of shoes ( http://github.com/why/shoes/tree/master ).
  ... rubigen to create app templaes
  ... active_record/resource for db and webservice access
  ... active_support for nice ruby extensions and I18n
  ... qtruby and qtext for the underlying widget rendering (can change in the future)
  ... some other extensions (dbus) and ideas from RoR
  ... ruby-opengl for opengl support ;) (more on the why later)


How it should work(but does not right now):
  indigo my_app
  cd my_app
  script/generate .. create models and views
  script/start
